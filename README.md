# Jenkins Tag Cloud Plugin

A Jenkins plugin which scans a project's source and generates a tag cloud of commonly used words. Taken from an idea demonstrated by [Kevlin Henney](http://twitter.com/kevlinhenney) at a recent [Bash.ie](http://bash.ie/Events/kevlin/) event in Belfast, NI.

## To Do

* Localization of configuration UI elements.

## Thanks To

* [Open Cloud](http://opencloud.mcavallo.org/) for the library which generates the tag clouds.
